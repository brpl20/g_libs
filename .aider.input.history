+ok, thanks, now create two boards, one for the events that are market in the color green in the google calendar and have this pattern: @[A-Z][A-Z][A-Z] text ... some examples @ADV trabalho  @MKT diversos @PES coisas , them give the total amount of each group and the total amount of each entry... for the things that are not following this pattern create a second board. also, create a small table that indicates the total hours without summing the day and the averate per working day (5 days week) .... also create a STORE DB function to when the month is finished and everything is alright the user will run the command and the month will be stored into an database for permanent checking, after that point you will not send the request anymore to the google calendar, you will keep only checking the local database... only if the users asks for an specified time that is not in the database and finished that you need to request for google calendar...

+ok, you didn't undertood. the category will be market with @ and tree letters for example "@ADV" "@PRJ" and the subcategory is what comes next for example: "@ADV diversos" "@PJR oab_ocr", "@PES academia" so you need to sort according to the category and them the subcategories.... if there is anything differente from this, for example "@PRJ@ academia" or "PRJ diveros" or "# DIVERSOS #" you must ignore it... this is the main categorizator... for the other `uncategorized_events` keep the same aproach....
